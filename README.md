# IoT-Control Webapplication
A webapplication for controlling your IoT devices, with a focus on a Material design. This application provides a user interface for controlling your IoT devices. It communicates with a server to display your devices and to control them.

## Requirements
This webapplication will require the server to communicate via Websockets and implement certain methods that are yet to be defined.

## Dependencies
This project uses [material ui](http://material-ui.com/#/) components on top of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) (a javascript library for building user interfaces). It will also use HTML5 native Websockets to communicate with a server (the implementation of this server is outside the scope of this project).
